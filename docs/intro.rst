Introduction
============

Picrin is a lightweight R7RS scheme implementation written in pure C89. It contains a reasonably fast VM, an improved hygienic macro system, usuful contribution libraries, and simple but powerful C interface.

- R7RS compatible
- Reentrant design (all VM states are stored in single global state object)
- Bytecode interpreter
- Direct threaded VM
- Internal representation by nan-boxing (available only on x64)
- Conservative call/cc implementation (VM stack and native c stack can interleave)
- Exact GC (simple mark and sweep, partially reference count)
- String representation by rope
- Hygienic macro transformers (syntactic closures, explicit and implicit renaming macros)
- Extended library syntax
